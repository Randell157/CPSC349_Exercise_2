      Hello! My name is Randell Lapid. I'm currently a Computer Science major at
      CSUF. I'm currently learning about web development and how websites are
      created and maintained on the internet (Utilizing HTML, CSS, and
      Javascript). In my free time, I like to play many games, ranging from FPS
      to RPGs to open world and many others. The current games that I'm playing
      are Genshin and Honkai Star Rail (I may be a bit deep into the gacha
      rabbit hole). I also like playing a bit of Bloons TD 6, Terraria,
      Minecraft, and Call of Duty Zombies mode. I also like watching tv shows
      and anime, but mainly go to Youtube for watching creators that I enjoy as
      well as learning more about topics that seem interesting and other random
      videos that may pop up on my homepage.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Some of the programming languages I learned about are C++ and Java. Also a
      bit of SQL. Currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this class. I
      would like to learn other programming languages such as Python and C#.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a table showing my knowledge of some programming languages:</p>
